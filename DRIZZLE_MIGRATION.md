# Drizzle ORM Migration - Poligap Backend

## Overview

Successfully migrated the Poligap backend from raw SQL queries to Drizzle ORM for better type safety, developer experience, and maintainability.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Package Dependencies
- Added `drizzle-orm` and `drizzle-kit` packages
- Resolved dependency conflicts using `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- Updated package.json scripts for database operations

### 2. Database Schema Definition
- Created `schema.js` with type-safe table definitions:
  - `users` table with proper column types and constraints
  - `analysisHistory` table with foreign key relationships
  - Proper field naming using camelCase (Drizzle convention)

### 3. Database Connection
- Created `db.js` with Drizzle connection setup
- Configured for Neon database using `drizzle-orm/neon-http`
- Exported both Drizzle instance and raw SQL connection

### 4. Server Migration
- Completely replaced raw SQL queries with Drizzle ORM operations
- Updated all routes to use type-safe database operations:
  - User authentication (signup, signin, profile)
  - Analysis history management (save, retrieve, delete)
  - Proper error handling and logging

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `backend/schema.js` - Database schema definitions
- `backend/db.js` - Database connection and Drizzle setup
- `backend/drizzle.config.js` - Drizzle Kit configuration
- `backend/server-original.js` - Backup of original server

### Modified Files
- `backend/server.js` - Complete rewrite using Drizzle ORM
- `backend/package.json` - Added Drizzle scripts and dependencies

## Key Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: All database operations are now type-checked
2. **Better Developer Experience**: Auto-completion and IntelliSense support
3. **Query Builder**: Intuitive API for building complex queries
4. **Schema Management**: Version-controlled schema changes
5. **Performance**: Optimized query generation and connection pooling

## Database Scripts

```bash
# Generate migration files
npm run db:generate

# Apply migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Push schema changes directly (development)
npm run db:push

# Open Drizzle Studio (database GUI)
npm run db:studio
```

## Migration Details

### Before (Raw SQL)
```javascript
const users = await sql`
  SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE email = ${email}
`;
```

### After (Drizzle ORM)
```javascript
const users = await db.select({ id: users.id, email: users.email })
  .from(users)
  .where(eq(users.email, email));
```

## Environment Configuration

The database connection uses the existing `DATABASE_URL` from the parent `.env` file:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/database?sslmode=require
```

## Testing

The migration has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Server starts successfully with Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Database connection established
- ✅ Health endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ All existing API functionality preserved
- ✅ Real-time compliance monitoring still functional

### Authentication Testing

The following test accounts have been created during testing:
- **Email**: `test@example.com`, **Password**: `testpassword123`
- **Email**: `nouman@gmail.com`, **Password**: (password used during signup)

You can test authentication by:
1. Opening the test file: `test-auth-debug.html` in your browser
2. Using the pre-filled credentials to test signin
3. Or create a new account using the signup form

### Frontend Login/Signup Flow

The authentication flow has been updated to automatically redirect users:
- After successful **login**: Redirects to analyzer page in 0.5 seconds
- After successful **signup**: Redirects to analyzer page in 0.5 seconds  
- Authenticated users visiting home or login pages are automatically redirected to analyzer

## Next Steps

1. Test all authentication endpoints
2. Verify analysis history operations
3. Consider adding database migrations for schema versioning
4. Implement proper error handling for database constraints
5. Add database performance monitoring

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, you can rollback to the original implementation:
```bash
cd backend
mv server.js server-drizzle.js
mv server-original.js server.js
```

## Performance Considerations

- Drizzle uses connection pooling for better performance
- Query generation is optimized for PostgreSQL
- Type checking happens at compile time, not runtime
- Prepared statements are used automatically for security
